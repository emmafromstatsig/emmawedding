  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;">John & Emma are getting married... sort of! 🎉</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Party</h2>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> Friday, March 7, 2026<br>
    <strong>Location:</strong> Headwaters Events Center, Winter Park, CO</p>
    <p>We're eloping privately, but this is the main event we want you to come to. It'll be food, drinks, music, good company — no aisle, no vows, just a celebration.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Weekend Schedule</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Friday Night:</strong> Welcome drinks at Idlewild Brewery 🍻</li>
      <li><strong>Saturday Morning:</strong> Cross-country skiing at YMCA of the Rockies ⛷️</li>
      <li><strong>Saturday Night:</strong> Wedding reception at Headwaters Events Center 💃🕺 <br> (We'll have transportation to and from the venue!)</li>
      <li><strong>Sunday:</strong> Optional hot springs soak at Hot Sulphur Springs ♨️</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>How to Get There</h2>
    <p>Winter Park is about 90 minutes from Denver. You’ve got a couple solid options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>🚗 Rent a car</strong> — Recommended if you want max flexibility</li>
      <li><strong>🚆 Take the ski train</strong> — Amtrak’s Winter Park Express runs from Union Station in Denver straight to Winter Park (it’s scenic and cool)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <dl class="faq">
      <dt>Wait, I thought this was your wedding?</dt>
      <dd>Technically it's our wedding party! We're eloping earlier just the two of us (less planning). This party is the celebration with everyone we love.</dd>

      <dt>What should I wear?</dt>
      <dd>Something festive and comfortable — think mountain casual. There will be space to swap snow boots for heels if you feel so inclined. Jeans fine. Sweaters fine. Pls no white dresses.</dd>

      <dt>Can I bring my kids?</dt>
      <dd>Yes! Kind of. If your crotch goblins are invited, we will specify on the invite 🙂</dd>

      <dt>Where should I stay?</dt>
      <dd>Winter Park has plenty of Airbnbs and hotels. We’ll share a few recommendations soon.</dd>

      <dt>Will there be food and dancing?</dt>
      <dd>Absolutely. Come hungry.</dd>

       <dt>Do you want gifts?</dt>
      <dd>Nope! Truly. Your presence means everything to us and we realize that getting to Winter Park isn't easy. That said, we’ve been told some folks will insist.<br><br>
